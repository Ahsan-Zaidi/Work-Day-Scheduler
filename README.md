## Description

🔍Being a web developer means being part of a community. You’ll need a place to share your projects not only if you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also so that you can share your work with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects.

I have created a password generator through Javascript, its purpose is to generate a password based on the users selected criteria. Then display the password for the user.

## ✋User Story

I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## ✋Acceptance Criteria

* WHEN I click the button to generate a password THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
* WHEN prompted for password criteria THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
* WHEN prompted for the length of the password THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
* WHEN asked for character types to include in the password THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
* WHEN I answer each prompt THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
* WHEN all prompts are answered THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
* WHEN the password is generated THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
