## Description

🔍Being a web developer means being part of a community. You’ll need a place to share your projects not only if you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also so that you can share your work with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects.

I have created a work day scheduler through javascript and third party apis. The purpose of this application is to keep your day organized without having a physical planner.

✋ [GitHub Repository]


✋ [Deployed App]


## ✋User Story

I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## ✋Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
